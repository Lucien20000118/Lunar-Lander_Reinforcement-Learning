# Reinforcement Learning Project

## Environment
- Developed based on OpenAI Gym's Lunar Lander Environment.
- Added a new action (jet propulsion on top of the lander).
- Introduced obstacles.
- Modified the designated landing area.
- Adjusted the target objective.

## Technology
Using PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization).

## Objective
To enable the Lunar Lander to safely land on a designated platform without colliding with obstacles.
